## 🔧 Build Error Fixed

### Issue:
```
Type error: comparison between OrderStatus and 'PROCESSING' have no overlap
```

### Fix Applied (Commit: 558f00d):
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const processingOrders = orders.filter(o => o.status === 'CONFIRMED' || o.status === 'PROCESSING').length
// ❌ 'PROCESSING' doesn't exist in OrderStatus enum

// AFTER (FIXED):
const confirmedOrders = orders.filter(o => o.status === 'CONFIRMED').length
// ✅ Using correct enum values
```

---

## 📋 OrderStatus Enum (From Prisma Schema):

Valid values:
- ✅ `PENDING`
- ✅ `CONFIRMED`
- ✅ `SHIPPED`
- ✅ `DELIVERED`
- ✅ `CANCELLED`
- ✅ `REFUNDED`

**Note**: There is NO `PROCESSING` status in the enum!
