# Google OAuth & Orders System - Complete Fix

## 🔐 Google OAuth Integration - FIXED

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing PrismaAdapter** - Was manually managing users instead of using NextAuth's built-in adapter
2. **Session conflicts** - OAuth and credentials authentication were not properly integrated
3. **Account linking** - Google accounts can now properly link with existing email accounts
4. **Context integration** - Auth context now properly checks both NextAuth and custom sessions

### Changes Made:

#### 1. `/lib/auth.ts` - Complete OAuth Configuration
- ✅ Added `PrismaAdapter(db)` for proper OAuth flow
- ✅ Added `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true` to link Google accounts with existing emails
- ✅ Simplified `signIn` callback - PrismaAdapter handles user creation automatically
- ✅ Enhanced `jwt` callback with token refresh support
- ✅ Added `events` handler to set default CUSTOMER role for new Google users
- ✅ Increased session duration to 30 days

#### 2. `/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Better Google Sign-In UX
- ✅ Added loading toast: "Redirecting to Google..."
- ✅ Better error handling for OAuth errors
- ✅ Clear error messages for account linking issues

#### 3. `/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Better Google Sign-Up UX
- ✅ Added loading toast: "Redirecting to Google..."
- ✅ Clear messaging: "Quick • Secure • No password needed"
- ✅ Proper error handling

#### 4. `/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Dual Session Support
- ✅ Checks NextAuth session first (for OAuth users)
- ✅ Falls back to localStorage session (for credentials users)
- ✅ Proper logout that clears both NextAuth and custom sessions
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

### Database Setup:

The following tables are required (already in schema):
- `accounts` - OAuth provider accounts
- `sessions` - User sessions
- `verification_tokens` - Email verification
- `users` - Updated with `image` and `emailVerified` fields

### Migration:

Run one of these commands to set up database:

```bash
# Option 1: Prisma Migrate (Recommended)
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_oauth_support

# Option 2: Direct SQL (if preferred)
mysql -u user -p database < prisma/migrations/add_oauth_support.sql

# Option 3: Quick sync for development
npx prisma db push
```

### Environment Variables Required:

```env
# Google OAuth (Get from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or production URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
```

### Google Cloud Console Setup:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create project or select existing
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Credentials → Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - **Local**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - **Production**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

### How It Works:

#### New User Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth consent screen
3. User authorizes
4. PrismaAdapter creates:
   - User record (with image, emailVerified, role=CUSTOMER)
   - Account record (linking to Google)
   - Session record
5. User is logged in ✅

#### Existing User Flow:
1. User with email account clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth flow
3. PrismaAdapter finds existing user by email
4. Links Google account to existing user
5. Updates profile picture and emailVerified
6. User can now login with either method ✅

## 🛒 Orders System - CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES

### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE FIXED:

**Before**: ALL users were seeing the FIRST user's orders!
```typescript
// ❌ DANGEROUS - Was using first user for everyone
const firstUser = await db.user.findFirst()
const userId = firstUser.id
```

**After**: Each user only sees their OWN orders
```typescript
// ✅ SECURE - Gets authenticated user from session
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
const userId = session.user.id
// Only queries: WHERE userId = authenticated_user_id
```

### Changes Made:

#### 1. `/app/api/orders/route.ts` - Secure Authentication

**GET Endpoint** (Fetch Orders):
- ✅ Authenticates user via NextAuth session (OAuth users)
- ✅ Authenticates user via cookie (credentials users)
- ✅ Returns 401 if not authenticated
- ✅ **Filters by `userId`** - ONLY shows user's own orders
- ✅ Filters out failed payments by default
- ✅ Shows PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED payments
- ✅ Includes payment status in response

**POST Endpoint** (Create Order):
- ✅ Requires authentication
- ✅ Uses authenticated user's ID
- ✅ Returns 401 if not authenticated
- ✅ Validates stock before creating order

#### 2. `/app/orders/page.tsx` - Payment Status Display

**Payment Status Indicators:**
- ✅ **PENDING** - Yellow badge: "⚠️ Complete payment to confirm order"
- ✅ **PROCESSING** - Blue badge: "Processing Payment"
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Green badge: "Paid ✓"
- ✅ **FAILED** - Red badge: "❌ Please retry payment"
- ✅ **REFUNDED** - Gray badge: "Refunded"

**UI Improvements:**
- ✅ Prominent payment status display
- ✅ Payment method shown (if available)
- ✅ Clear warnings for unpaid orders
- ✅ Order status badges (Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered, etc.)
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile

### Security Features:

1. **User Isolation**: Each user can ONLY see their own orders
2. **Authentication Required**: 401 error if not logged in
3. **Dual Auth Support**: Works with both OAuth and credentials login
4. **Payment Filtering**: Only shows relevant payment statuses
5. **Detailed Logging**: All API calls are logged for debugging

### Order Display Logic:

**What Users See:**
- ✅ Orders with payment status: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED
- ✅ Clear indication if payment is incomplete
- ✅ Order history with payment details
- ✅ Only their own orders (never other users' orders)

**What Users Don't See:**
- ❌ Other users' orders (FIXED - was showing first user's orders to everyone)
- ❌ Failed payment orders (unless specifically filtered)
- ❌ Cancelled payment orders (unless specifically filtered)

### Database Fields Used:

From `Order` model:
- `userId` - **CRITICAL**: Links order to specific user
- `status` - Order status (PENDING, CONFIRMED, SHIPPED, etc.)
- `paymentStatus` - Payment status (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- `paymentMethod` - How user paid (UPI, Card, etc.)
- `paymentAmount` - Amount actually paid
- `totalAmount` - Order total
- `paymentTransactionId` - Payment gateway transaction ID

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Before Deploying:

1. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - NEXTAUTH_URL (production URL)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (strong random string)
   - MYSQL_URL (database connection)

2. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

3. **Update Google Cloud Console**:
   - Add production redirect URI
   - Update authorized JavaScript origins

4. **Test on Production**:
   - Test Google sign-in
   - Test order creation
   - Test user isolation (CRITICAL)

### Post-Deployment Verification:

```bash
# Check logs for:
✅ [ORDERS API] User authenticated via NextAuth: user@example.com
✅ [ORDERS API] Fetching orders for userId: clx...
✅ [ORDERS API] Found X orders (total: X)

# Should NEVER see:
❌ [ORDERS API] Using first user (THIS WAS THE BUG)
❌ [ORDERS API] No authenticated user found (unless user not logged in)
```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs**: Look for colored emoji logs (🟢, 🔴, ⚠️)
2. **Verify environment variables**: All OAuth credentials set?
3. **Check database**: Do OAuth tables exist?
4. **Test authentication**: Can you log in?
5. **Test isolation**: Create orders with different users

**Common Issues:**
- "No authenticated user found" → Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET and session
- "redirect_uri_mismatch" → Update Google Console redirect URIs
- "Database not configured" → Check MYSQL_URL
- Orders showing for wrong user → SHOULD BE FIXED NOW ✅
