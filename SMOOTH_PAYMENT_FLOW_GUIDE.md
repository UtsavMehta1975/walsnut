## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Before (Buggy):**

```typescript
// WRONG! Uses first user from database
const firstUser = await db.user.findFirst()
const userId = firstUser.id

customer_details: {
  customer_id: userId,           // ❌ Random user!
  customer_email: firstUser.email, // ❌ Wrong email!
}
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Payment could be for wrong customer
- ❌ Session not validated
- ❌ First user != current user
- ❌ Data mismatch errors

---

### **After (Fixed):**

```typescript
// CORRECT! Uses user from order
const order = await db.order.findUnique({
  where: { id: orderId },
  include: { user: true }  // ✅ Get customer who placed order
})

customer_details: {
  customer_id: order.user.id,        // ✅ Correct customer!
  customer_email: order.user.email!, // ✅ Correct email!
  customer_phone: order.user.phone,  // ✅ Correct phone!
  customer_name: order.user.name     // ✅ Correct name!
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Always correct customer
- ✅ Validated against order
- ✅ Proper error if user missing
- ✅ Works for all login types
- ✅ No session mismatches

---

## 📊 **Session Validation at Each Step**

### **Step 1: Checkout**
```typescript
// Order API checks session (3 ways):
1. NextAuth session (Google users) ✅
2. Cookie session (Password users) ✅
3. Guest info (Guest checkout) ✅

// Always gets valid userId
```

### **Step 2: Order Creation**
```typescript
// Order created with userId from session ✅
// Order.user relationship established ✅
// Address saved to user profile ✅
```

### **Step 3: Payment**
```typescript
// Payment API gets order.user ✅
// Uses actual customer info ✅
// No need to check session again ✅
// Order already has valid userId ✅
```

### **Step 4: Success**
```typescript
// Payment verified ✅
// Order status updated ✅
// Email sent to correct customer ✅
```
